For the JavaScript version of Calculator, the parsing algorithm is the 
same as in the C version.  The biggest difference is that is has a 
graphical user interface in the form of a webpage.  The graphics
and the layout are rudimentary, but it is miles ahead of the command
line.

As of now, this version supports five operators (+, -, *, /, and ^)
but not parentheses.
